ARRAY SECTION:
problems: 12 onwards.

MAIN -
1) Rotate an array: 3 types.
    a) Simple
    b) Block Swap
    c) Reversal Algorithm:
            Let the array be arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d =2 and n = 7
            A = [1, 2] and B = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

            Reverse A, we get ArB = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
            Reverse B, we get ArBr = [2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
            Reverse all, we get (ArBr)r = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]

2) Finding Array pivot.
